# Late August Burnout Trip

> Transcript-ish mess of seven idiots in their early twenties trying to squeeze one more memory out of summer before real life eats them. Recorded out by Pineknife Lake, thirty miles from cell service, twenty years past when anyone should've felt safe there.

## 1. Gas station prelude, 5:37 p.m.

**Malik:** (finger-gunning) "Last chance, bro. Say the word and I'll grab the gummy bears shaped like boobs. Road-trip tradition."

**Diego:** "We're twenty-four. Maybe retire the horny-candy bit?"

**Spencer:** "Speak for yourself, I'm buying the chili-lime peanuts that smell like a hangover. Also, Malik, the ones shaped like boobs are five bucks more. Patriarchy surcharge."

**Tori:** (yelling from coffee machine) "Somebody bring me real food. The pump coffee tastes like burnt pennies and regret."

**Rhea:** "You poured three creamers in there."

**Tori:** "Because I care about my bones? Shut up." (beat) "Junie, you good? You've been staring at the missing-person flyer for five minutes."

**Juniper:** "The dates overlap with last year's wildfire. Feels like the forest is still keeping its own casualty list."

**Lana:** "Okay, I did not sign up for haunted math. Can we just load the van?"

**Malik:** (aside to Diego) "Still dodging, huh?"

**Diego:** "Dodging what?"

**Malik:** "The fact that you look at—"

**Diego:** "Nope." (grabs basket) "Snacks now, gossip never."

**Spencer:** "Bro, at least admit one of them makes your stomach do the stupid rollercoaster thing."

**Diego:** "My stomach hates everyone equally."

**Malik:** "So you calling them all ugly? Ballsy strategy."

**Diego:** "I said my stomach hates everyone. Not my eyes. But if we're forcing the issue?"

**Spencer:** (leans in) "Yeah?"

**Diego:** "They're all not my type. Happy?"

**Malik:** "That's a lie, and your face knows it."

**Spencer:** "Dude, you've been carrying Juniper's dumb folklore zine in your backpack for two months."

**Diego:** (eyes narrow) "It's for research."

**Malik:** "Research in how to spell 'smitten,' maybe."

**Diego:** "Eat your boob bears." (walks off)

Juniper watches Diego go, brow furrowed. She mouths "what was that" to Lana, who shrugs.

## 2. The drive into nowhere, 7:12 p.m.

Van dashboard squeaks every fifth pothole. Malik records a TikTok rant he'll never post. Sun slides down like a busted bulb.

**Tori:** "Can we please stop talking about the fact the ranger station burned down last year?"

**Juniper:** "Technically it collapsed from dry rot before the fire."

**Lana:** "Literally zero comfort, thanks."

**Spencer:** (nose in map) "We follow Pineknife Road until Mile Marker 12. Then there's a logging trail."

**Rhea:** "The one the missing-person flyer mentioned?"

**Spencer:** "Look, a thousand trails share one creepy anecdote. Odds are in our favor."

**Malik:** "Diego, you alive back there?"

**Diego:** (from third row, voice muffled) "Hydrating."

**Tori:** "Hydrating on what?"

**Diego:** "Warm Gatorade because SOMEONE put the cooler in the trunk."

**Malik:** "Say the word, and I'll dig it out when we stop."

**Diego:** "How about you stop trying to play matchmaker and just drive."

**Malik:** "Just saying, last summer you moped around after Sam moved to Denver. Maybe don't repeat the lonely hero arc."

**Diego:** "Maybe shut up."

**Juniper:** (softly) "Hey, you good back there?"

**Diego:** "Peachy." (beat) "You know the story about Pineknife?"

**Juniper:** "The short version or the thesis?"

**Diego:** "The one where it whispers at night."

**Juniper:** "I mean, that's all forests if you listen long enough."

**Tori:** "Nope, do not start."

**Rhea:** "Too late, she's narrating."

**Juniper:** "Local legend says there's this echo—"

**Lana:** "I'm putting my earbuds in."

**Juniper:** "—that sounds like someone you love. It waits until you're alone."

**Spencer:** "Sweet, ghost voice phishing for simps."

**Malik:** "Diego, if the trees start moaning your name, maybe say yes?"

**Diego:** "I'm leaping out of the van."

## 3. Campsite arrival, 9:03 p.m.

They pitch tents under a sky clotted with stars and wildfire haze. Someone forgot tent stakes (Spencer). Someone brought three Bluetooth speakers (Tori). The lake looks like a bruise.

**Rhea:** (snapping photos) "The light is insane. Like, end-of-the-world postcard insane."

**Lana:** "If I end up on some true-crime Reddit, delete my LinkedIn."

**Malik:** "Noted. Also, Diego, your tent's sagging. Need a hand?"

**Diego:** "I'm good."

**Juniper:** (tugging a rope) "You looped it wrong. Here." (brushes his wrist) "Sorry, my hands are freezing."

**Diego:** (too fast) "It's fine."

**Juniper:** "You sure you're cool camping? Last time you were outdoorsy was sophomore year when you puked on a canoe."

**Diego:** "Wow, thanks for the reminder."

**Malik:** (stage whisper to Spencer) "He's redder than the sunset."

**Spencer:** "Bet you twenty he'll blame it on the campfire later."

**Tori:** "Can we just get drunk already? I brought the bottle of mezcal with the weird worm."

**Lana:** "That worm is a larva."

**Tori:** "Cool science, shot time."

They pass the bottle. Smoke curls, ash freckles sweaty skin. Someone puts on a playlist that's all moody indie tracks and then abruptly early-2000s pop.

## 4. Firelight confessions, 11:48 p.m.

**Tori:** "Okay, new rule. Everyone shares the worst thing they almost did this summer."

**Rhea:** "Pass."

**Tori:** "No passes."

**Lana:** "I nearly quit my internship by sending a meme to the CEO."

**Spencer:** "I tried to start a pop-up restaurant in our apartment without telling our landlord."

**Malik:** "I DM'd my ex at 2 a.m. asking if she wanted to arm-wrestle."

**Juniper:** "I... almost told my mom I remember more about that night at Pineknife than I let on."

Silence. Juniper stares into the fire until tears well up without falling.

**Diego:** "Wait, you've been here before?"

**Juniper:** "Yeah. Seventeen. Scout trip. One of the girls wandered off after midnight. We never found her."

**Tori:** "You said it was just folklore."

**Juniper:** "Because the truth sounds worse."

**Malik:** "Why didn't you tell us?"

**Juniper:** "Because every time I talk about it I hear—" She clamps her hands over her ears. "It's starting again."

**Diego:** "Starting what?"

**Juniper:** (whispers) "The voice." She stands up, sways. "I'm going to the lake. Need air."

**Diego:** "I'll go."

**Malik:** "Bro—"

**Diego:** "Relax."

They disappear into the dark, flashlights slicing the woods.

## 5. Lakeside echoes, 12:06 a.m.

Wind shivers across water. Somewhere a loon shrieks like a dying violin.

**Juniper:** "You shouldn't be here."

**Diego:** "Neither should you."

**Juniper:** "I mean tonight. If something happens—"

**Diego:** "Malik thinks I'm into you."

**Juniper:** "Are you?"

**Diego:** "I don't do crushes."

**Juniper:** "That's not what I asked."

**Diego:** "You want honesty? You're intense. You collect tragedies like other people collect vinyl. It's exhausting."

**Juniper:** "Wow."

**Diego:** "But."

**Juniper:** "But what?"

**Diego:** "You're also the only one who knows how to listen when everyone's yelling."

**Juniper:** "That's literally my degree."

**Diego:** "I didn't come out here to flirt. I came because you looked like you were about to walk into the lake and disappear."

**Juniper:** "I wanted to see if it still remembers me."

**Diego:** "The lake?"

**Juniper:** "The thing inside it."

**Diego:** "Fantastic." (rubs face) "Malik's going to say I finally admitted you're not ugly."

**Juniper:** "Do you think I'm ugly?"

**Diego:** "No." (beat) "You're terrifying."

**Juniper:** (laughs, then sobers) "Listen." She closes her eyes.

Wind dies. A new sound rolls in—soft, pleading, familiar. It says "Junie" in Diego's voice.

**Diego:** "I'm not—"

**Voice:** "Junie, come back."

**Juniper:** "Do you hear it?"

**Diego:** "No."

**Voice:** "You left me."

**Juniper:** "It's not you. It's her."

**Diego:** "Who?"

**Juniper:** "The girl we lost. She used to call me Junie."

She steps toward the water. Diego grabs her wrist.

**Diego:** "Nope."

**Juniper:** "Let go."

**Voice:** "I need you."

**Juniper:** "If I go, maybe she'll stop."

**Diego:** "If you go, we'll lose you."

**Juniper:** "Maybe that's what the forest wants."

**Diego:** "I don't care what the forest wants."

He pulls her back. She collapses against him, shaking. The voice fades.

## 6. Back at camp, 12:32 a.m.

Malik paces. Tori has another shot. Lana mutters work emails in her sleep. Rhea scrolls through photos, deleting any where Juniper looks haunted.

**Malik:** "Took you long enough."

**Diego:** "She almost walked into the lake."

**Tori:** "Jesus."

**Juniper:** "I'm fine." (she's not)

**Spencer:** "Do we bail in the morning?"

**Juniper:** "If we leave now, it follows."

**Rhea:** "It?"

**Juniper:** "The echo. It doesn't like being ignored."

**Malik:** "What do you need?"

**Juniper:** "Someone awake with me. Until sunrise."

**Diego:** "I'll stay."

**Malik:** "Thought they were all 'not your type.'"

**Diego:** "Shut up."

**Juniper:** "I'm sorry I dragged you into my mess."

**Diego:** "We're all messes. Yours just hums." He smirks. "Plus, you're definitely not ugly."

**Malik:** (from across the fire) "HA! Called it."

**Diego:** "I hate you."

**Juniper:** "No you don't."

They sit with their backs against the same tree, listening to the wind test the tent ropes. Every so often, Juniper twitches like she's hearing a name. Diego keeps whispering "Stay here" until the words lose meaning.

---

## 7. Sunrise hangover, 6:11 a.m.

Sky bleeds pink. Birds scream. Everyone looks wrecked.

**Tori:** "I dreamed the mezcal worm was doing laps in my stomach."

**Lana:** "I dreamed our boss bought the campsite."

**Rhea:** "I didn't sleep."

**Spencer:** "I wrote a menu called 'Forest Appetites.'"

**Malik:** "I heard whispers saying 'stop pushing him.'"

**Juniper:** (glaring at Malik) "Maybe listen."

**Malik:** "Fine."

**Diego:** "We're leaving after breakfast."

**Tori:** "What happened to soaking in the lake?"

**Juniper:** "The lake's full of ghosts."

**Rhea:** "Did it talk again?"

**Juniper:** "No. Diego wouldn't let it."

**Malik:** "Look at you, hero."

**Diego:** "Don't."

**Juniper:** "He's right though." (smiles, small but real) "Thanks for keeping me here."

**Diego:** "Whatever."

**Malik:** "Translation: 'You're welcome, not-ugly person I maybe like.'"

**Diego:** "Translation: 'I'm buying noise-canceling headphones for the next trip so I can't hear you.'"

They pack up. The forest stays quiet, as if disappointed. Malik hums to fill the silence. Juniper pockets a smooth stone she swears is warm.

On the drive back, Diego leans his head against the rattling window. He looks at Juniper's reflection, caught between trees flickering past. She catches him staring.

**Juniper:** "What?"

**Diego:** "I owe you an apology."

**Juniper:** "For calling me exhausting?"

**Diego:** "For pretending I don't care."

**Juniper:** "Apology accepted."

She rests her head on his shoulder. Malik glances in the rearview, grins like a wolf, and says nothing for once.

The lake disappears behind them, but the echo doesn't. It rattles around inside Diego's ribcage, whispering her name, reminding him that sometimes the scariest thing isn't whatever waits in the dark, but admitting who you want to sit beside when it shows up.
